# BGG-suggestions
The board games world is absolutely wide: every day a new product is released or is launched on Kickstarter or receives a digital versions...

For all these reasons and many others, is quite difficult to keep an eye on the board games that can suit us and doing this by hand, can become a huge waste of time checking online pages, rulebooks or YouTube videos.

Here, this little repository comes to help everyone.

Starting from everyone's BGG collection, it makes an analysis of each game we own and want to buy or play and cross-check these games with the BGG hotness.

## What is BGG?
If you don't know what BGG is, it stands for "BoardGameGeek" and it is a global board games encyclopedia where you can find any board game (and not only, it also works with rpg, expansions...) checking its mechanisms, which kind of game it is, who created it, photos, reviews...

On this site you can also manage a personal collection of games you own, want to play, want to buy.

Finally, BGG also manages a hotness page where the most important games of the moment are included, and it is continuously updated with a ranking (from 1 to 50).

**The idea behind this repository is to suggest some of the hottest BGG boardgame according the features of the games each user already added to their collection on the same platform**
